# About

This repo stores the configuration files of my most used TUIs using GNU stow:

- ZShell
- Tmux
- Neovim

## Instructions

### Adding files to the repo

- Move the file(s) to ~/.dotfiles with the same structure as in their original location.
- Run '$ stow -t <_target directory_>'

### Removing files from the repo

- Run '$stow -D .' to unstow the file(s)
- Move the file back(s) to their original location.
